Sodium chloride commonly known as salt is an ionic compound with the chemical formula NaCl, representing a 1:1 ratio of sodium and chloride ions. <br>With molar masses of 22.99 and 35.45 g/mol respectively, 100 g of NaCl contains 39.34 g Na and 60.66 g Cl. Salt is perhaps most well-known for its roles as a flavouring agent and as a food preservative in both home cooking and food processing.<br>
Now consider this situation: <br>
Let’s assume for a unit rise in temperature, the solubility of salt in water increases by B g/100 mL.<br>
Gordy does an experiment to check how much salt (in g) he can dissolve provided he initially has 1 litre of water at X degrees and the solubility of salt at this temperature is A g/100 mL.<br> Also, Gordy doesn't want to lose any water so he can increase the temperature to a maximum of 100 degrees.<br>
Assuming no loss of water takes place during the process, find the maximum amount of salt (in g) that can be dissolved in 1 litre of water under the given conditions.<br>

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.<br>
The only line of each test case contains three integers  X, A, B.<br>
